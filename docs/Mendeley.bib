abstract = {Following the rapid development of genome-scale genotyping technologies, genetic association mapping has become a popular tool to detect genomic regions responsible for certain (disease) phenotypes, especially in early-phase pharmacogenomic studies with limited sample size. In response to such applications, a good association test needs to be (1) applicable to a wide range of possible genetic models, including, but not limited to, the presence of gene-by-environment or gene-by-gene interactions and non-linearity of a group of marker effects, (2) accurate in small samples, fast to compute on the genomic scale, and amenable to large scale multiple testing corrections, and (3) reasonably powerful to locate causal genomic regions. The kernel machine method represented in linear mixed models provides a viable solution by transforming the problem into testing the nullity of variance components. In this study, we consider score-based tests by choosing a statistic linear in the score function. When the model under the null hypothesis has only one error variance parameter, our test is exact in finite samples. When the null model has more than one variance parameter, we develop a new moment-based approximation that performs well in simulations. Through simulations and analysis of real data, we demonstrate that the new test possesses most of the aforementioned characteristics, especially when compared to existing quadratic score tests or restricted likelihood ratio tests.},

abstract = {Assessing genome-wide statistical significance is an important and difficult problem in multipoint linkage analysis. Due to multiple tests on the same genome, the usual pointwise significance level based on the chi-square approximation is inappropriate. Permutation is widely used to determine genome-wide significance. Theoretical approximations are available for simple experimental crosses. In this article, we propose a resampling procedure to assess the significance of genome-wide QTL mapping for experimental crosses. The proposed method is computationally much less intensive than the permutation procedure (in the order of 10(2) or higher) and is applicable to complex breeding designs and sophisticated genetic models that cannot be handled by the permutation and theoretical methods. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to a Drosophila backcross.},

The development of new analytical methods has made it valuable to re-analyze an F1 population (n=156) derived from a cross involving 'Atlantic', a widely grown chipping variety in the USA. A fully integrated genetic map with 4,285 single nucleotide polymorphisms, spanning 1,630 cM, was constructed with MAPpoly software. We observed that bivalent configurations were the most abundant ones (51.0{\~{}}72.4{\%} depending on parent and linkage group), though multivalent configurations were also observed (2.2{\~{}}39.2{\%}). Seven traits were evaluated over four years (2006-8 and 2014) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was carried out using QTLpoly software. We detected 21 QTL for 15 out of 27 trait-year combination phenotypes. A hotspot on linkage group 5 was identified as QTL for maturity, plant yield, specific gravity and internal heat necrosis resistance over different years were co-located. We found over 500 genes around QTL peaks, including those on chromosome 5 that have been previously implicated in maturity (StCDF1) and tuber formation (POTH1). These QTL regions can be investigated further in order to allow genomics-assisted breeding in tetraploid potato.},

abstract = {The hexaploid sweetpotato ( Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., 2n = 6x = 90) is an important staple food crop worldwide and plays a vital role in alleviating famine in developing countries. Due to its high ploidy level, genetic studies in sweetpotato lag behind major diploid crops significantly. We built an ultra-dense multilocus integrated genetic map and characterized the inheritance system in a sweetpotato full-sib family using our newly developed software, MAPpoly. The resulting genetic map revealed 96.5{\%} collinearity between I. batatas and its diploid relative I. trifida . We computed the genotypic probabilities across the whole genome for all individuals in the mapping population and inferred their complete hexaploid haplotypes. We provide evidence that most of the meiotic configurations (73.3{\%}) were resolved in bivalents, although a small portion of multivalent signatures (15.7{\%}), among other inconclusive configurations (11.0{\%}), were also observed. Except for low levels of preferential pairing in linkage group 2, we observed a hexasomic inheritance mechanism in all linkage groups. We propose that the hexasomic-bivalent inheritance promotes stability to the allelic transmission in sweetpotato.},

abstract = {In developing countries, the sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. ( 2 n = 6 x = 90 ) , is an important autopolyploid species, both socially and economically. However, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has remained limited due to its genetic complexity. Current fixed-effect models can fit only a single QTL and are generally hard to interpret. Here, we report the use of a random-effect model approach to map multiple QTL based on score statistics in a sweetpotato biparental population (‘Beauregard' × ‘Tanzania') with 315 full-sibs. Phenotypic data were collected for eight yield component traits in six environments in Peru, and jointly adjusted means were obtained using mixed-effect models. An integrated linkage map consisting of 30,684 markers distributed along 15 linkage groups (LGs) was used to obtain the genotype conditional probabilities of putative QTL at every centiMorgan position. Multiple interval mapping was performed using our R package QTL poly and detected a total of 13 QTL, ranging from none to four QTL per trait, which explained up to 55{\%} of the total variance. Some regions, such as those on LGs 3 and 15, were consistently detected among root number and yield traits, and provided a basis for candidate gene search. In addition, some QTL were found to affect commercial and noncommercial root traits distinctly. Further best linear unbiased predictions were decomposed into additive allele effects and were used to compute multiple QTL-based breeding values for selection. Together with quantitative genotyping and its appropriate usage in linkage analyses, this QTL mapping methodology will facilitate the use of genomic tools in sweetpotato breeding as well as in other autopolyploids.},

Methods for locating these quantitative trait loci (QTL) relative to maps of genetic markers are now widely used. This paper addresses an issue common to all QTL mapping methods, that of determining an appropriate threshold value for declaring significant QTL effects. An empirical method is described, based on the concept of a permutation test, for estimating threshold values that are tailored to the experimental data at hand. The method is demonstrated using two real data sets derived from F(2) and recombinant inbred plant populations. An example using simulated data from a backcross design illustrates the effect of marker density on threshold values.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: Dense linkage maps derived by analysing SNP dosage in autotetraploids provide detailed information about the location of, and genetic model at, quantitative trait loci. Recent developments in sequencing and genotyping technologies enable researchers to generate high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data for mapping studies. For polyploid species, the SNP genotypes are informative about allele dosage, and Hackett et al. (PLoS ONE 8:e63939, 2013) presented theory about how dosage information can be used in linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for an F1 population in an autotetraploid species. Here, QTL mapping using dosage information is explored for simulated phenotypic traits of moderate heritability and possibly non-additive effects. Different mapping strategies are compared, looking at additive and more complicated models, and model fitting as a single step or by iteratively re-weighted modelling. We recommend fitting an additive model without iterative re-weighting, and then exploring non-additive models for the genotype means estimated at the most likely position. We apply this strategy to re-analyse traits of high heritability from a potato population of 190 F1 individuals: flower colour, maturity, height and resistance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary) and potato cyst nematode (Globodera pallida), using a map of 3839 SNPs. The approximate confidence intervals for QTL locations have been improved by the detailed linkage map, and more information about the genetic model at each QTL has been revealed. For several of the reported QTLs, candidate SNPs can be identified, and used to propose candidate trait genes. We conclude that the high marker density is informative about the genetic model at loci of large effects, but that larger populations are needed to detect smaller QTLs.},

abstract = {Modern SNP genotyping technologies allow to measure the relative abundance of different alleles for a given locus, and consequently to estimate their allele dosage, opening a new road for genetic studies in autopolyploids. Despite advances in genetic linkage analysis in autotetraploids, there is a lack of statistical models to perform linkage analysis in organisms with higher ploidy levels. In this paper, we present a statistical method to estimate recombination fractions and infer linkage phases in full-sib populations of autopolyploid species with even ploidy levels in a sequence of SNP markers using hidden Markov models. Our method uses efficient two-point procedures to reduce the search space for the best linkage phase configuration and reestimates the final parameters using maximum-likelihood estimation of the Markov chain. To evaluate the method, and demonstrate its properties, we rely on simulations of autotetraploid, autohexaploid and autooctaploid populations. The results show the reliability of our approach, including situations with complex linkage phase scenarios in hexaploid and octaploid populations. Author summary In this paper we present a multilocus complete solution based in hidden Markov models to estimate recombination fractions and infer the linkage phase configuration in full-sib mapping populations with even ploidy levels under random chromosome segregation. We also present an efficient pairwise loci analysis to be used in cases were the multilocus analysis becomes compute-intensive.},
